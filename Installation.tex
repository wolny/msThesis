\section{Installation and Execution Instructions}
\label{sec:installation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Configuration files: \textit{application-context.xml} - here you
  specify used algorithms, problem domain, fitness function and other aspects
  of the system (see sample configuration in appendix B); some of the most
  important properties are taken from \textit{algorithm.properties} file
  using property placeholders 
  \item To build the project invoke: \textit{mvn clean install}. 
  \item Program execution: \textit{mvn exec:java} By default the main class of
  the project is:
  \textit{ki.edu.agh.algorithm.SequentialDeteriorationEAWithOpticsClustering}
  (see \textit{pom.xml} for more details)
\end{itemize}

\section{Program Results}
\label{sec:results}

Program saves the results in 'diagrams' catalog:
\begin{itemize}
 \item cluster's members are stored in files of the name 'clusterN', where N is
 the number of cluster 
 \item populations for each run are stored in files
 'populationN', where N is the number of EA run 
 \item fitness landscape is stored in file 'originalFitnessLand'
 \item reachablity plot for OPTICS algorithm is stored in ''reachabilityPlot'
 \item fitness landscape after each run is stored in 'fintessLand\_iterN' where
 N is the number of EA run
\end{itemize}
